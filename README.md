# GATE2023
## My gate preparation:

I decided to appear for GATE 2023 in month of May 2022. Started collecting information, from seniors; MTech VLSI guys who were very friendly and helped throughout the journey. Started GATE preperation in month of June. Was parallely doing internship at OFSS, literature survey and primary experimentation for final year project and a little bit preperations for placement. The internship was online which gave me a bit of relaxation. During this time, i used to study approx 2-3 hrs per day. After 2 months internship finished. Then came month of july and collage started. Here being a Student Mentor Co-ordinator, I had to look after my 15 mentees, co-ordinate with professor and fellow mentors. During the exam times like 4-5 days i used to stop the specific GATE related studies. I participated in many events like co-ordinator in CVIP conference, conducting labs for a GIAN course, instrumentals, debate, creative writing in institute gathering, and largely focusing on final year projects. Thus kept the pace of GATE preparation constant approx 3 hrs a day. On holiday it used to get stretched for 5-6 hrs. 
Roughly speaking, the marks distribution for EC paper is as follows - 
``1) Maths 15 marks 
2) apt 15 
3) ce 10
4) Lnt 10 
7) Dc 10
8) Analog  8 
9) Comm. 8
10) Sns 6
11) Edc 8
12) Emft 8``

For prepering the above topics I used following resources - 
1) Maths - NPTEL
2) apt 15 - Didn't prepare at all
3) ce 10 - GATE academy and my class notes
4) Lnt 10 - class notes (you can refer nptel)
5) Dc 10 - class notes (you can refer neso academy)
6) Analog  8 - class notes and nptel
7) Comm. 8 - class notes and nptel
8) Sns 6 - class notes (you can refer neso academy)
9) Edc 8 - class notes and nptel (refer digbijoy nath's playlist on nptel)
10) Emft 8 - class notes (reder Book of Sadiku) 

In my experience Few of our subjects are very well taught in ECE, whereas some need more push by external resources (no offence). All the above materials are available on youtube. For book you need to search on web or buy it. I did not need to join any tutions like Ace/Gate/etc.  

Most of the people skip EMFT and Communication. If you prepare that as well, then definitely could could get good rank. The exam is of 100 marks. Topper goes till 70 marks. Most of the croud lies in 55-65 range. So even a single question got wrong, rank varies by 50 if you are in that range.

I had planned 6 months in total for preparation out of which 4 months solely dedicated for theory and 2 months for question practice. I regret that i should have given more time for question practice. In the last month i joined ACE Academy's practice test series. I found that very useful because - 1) it covers all prev yr question papers. No need to solve explicitly 2) Tests are very well organized. Topic wise, subject wise, 3 subjects together, full length etc. 3) Affordable (economically)

some phukat ka Gyan -
The most important thing needed for preparing any compititive examination is consistancy. Motivation will lie for a couple of weeks. Even if you consider 6 months journey, you will need a stack of motivation to cheer you up weekly which you wont find anywhere. You have to keep pushing yourself and keep reminding your dream. Throw the lazyness in dustbin.
