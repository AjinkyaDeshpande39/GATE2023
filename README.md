## My gate preparation:
<li><I>Please note that I am narrating my experience and preperation strategy.</I>

I decided to appear for GATE 2023 in month of May 2022. Started collecting information, from seniors; MTech VLSI guys who were very friendly and helped throughout the journey. Started GATE preperation in month of June. Was parallely doing internship at OFSS, literature survey and primary experimentation for final year project and a little bit preperations for placement. The internship was online which gave me a bit of relaxation. During this time, i used to study approx 2 hrs per day. After 2 months internship finished. Then came month of july and collage started. Here being involved in a lot of activities the schedule continued. During the exam times like 4-5 days i used to stop the specific GATE related studies. I also participated in many events. Thus kept the pace of GATE preparation constant approx 2 hrs a day. Post Diwali, i stretched it to 3 hrs per day and on holidays it used to get stretched for 5-6 hrs. 

Roughly speaking, the marks distribution for EC paper is as follows - 
``1) Maths 15 marks 
2) apt 15 
3) ce 10
4) Lnt 10 
7) Dc 10
8) Analog  8 
9) Comm. 8
10) Sns 6
11) Edc 8
12) Emft 8``

For prepering the above topics I used following resources - 
1) Maths - NPTEL
2) apt 15 - Didn't prepare at all
3) ce 10 - GATE academy and my class notes
4) Lnt 10 - class notes (you can refer nptel)
5) Dc 10 - class notes (you can refer neso academy)
6) Analog  8 - class notes and nptel
7) Comm. 8 - class notes and nptel
8) Sns 6 - class notes (you can refer neso academy)
9) Edc 8 - class notes and nptel (refer digbijoy nath's playlist on nptel)
10) Emft 8 - class notes (reder Book of Sadiku) 

In my experience Few of our subjects are very well taught in ECE, whereas some need more push by external resources (no offence). All the above materials are available on youtube. For book you need to search on web or buy it. I did not need to join any tutions like Ace/Gate/etc. Other than the above resources, you will find plenty of telegram channels where free books and video lectures are avilable. While reading the topics, try to solve some questions which will make you memorize the formulae or those concepts.

Most of the people skip EMFT and Communication. If you prepare that as well, then definitely could could get good rank. The exam is of 100 marks. Topper goes till 70 marks. Most of the croud lies in 55-65 range. So even a single question got wrong, rank varies by 50 if you are in that range. 63,092 people appeared for EC GATE 2024 [citation](https://collegedunia.com/news/e-60-how-many-students-appear-register-for-gate). Later GATE committee converts your marks to score out of 1000.

I had planned 6 months in total for preparation out of which 4 months solely dedicated for theory and 2 months for question practice. But i suggest that you should allot more time for question practice. GATE is all about variety of questions and speed of solving those. Sometimes questions repeat in exam. In the last month i joined ACE Academy's practice test series. I found that very useful because - 1) it covers all prev yr question papers. No need to solve explicitly 2) Tests are very well organized. Topic wise, subject wise, 3 subjects together, full length etc. 3) Affordable (economically)


some phukat ka Gyan -
The most important thing needed for preparing any compititive examination is consistancy. Motivation will lie for a couple of weeks. Even if you consider 6 months journey, you will need a stack of motivation to cheer you up weekly which you wont find anywhere. You have to keep pushing yourself and keep reminding about your dream. Throw the lazyness in dustbin. Few regrets i have. I participated in a lot of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities which ate a lot of time. Thus couldn't provide enough time for practice.

With all this hustle, I managed to secure 691/1000 AIR370 in my first attempt.
